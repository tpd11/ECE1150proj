This is a repository to store the matlab files associated with the Computer Networks Channel Coding Project.

Files will include simulations for Linear Block codes, specifically Hamming and Reed-Solomon, as well as Convolutional codes and Turbo codes.

The files for Hamming, Reed_Solomon, and Convolutional simulations are .m files that just need to be opened and run. The Turbo Code simulation is a Simulink file with 2 .m files for punctured and unpunctured code that can be run in Simulink.
